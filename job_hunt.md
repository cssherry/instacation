# Top predictor for job search:
1) Number of applications
2) Tech background. Fine if you don't know lingo, however, if something generally techy comes up, (Hackernews) and know, then good. (Techcrunch)
TODO: Subscribe to hackerNews and Techcrunch
4) Performance in course, pedigree
- #1 (apply again), #2 (apply second), #3 (Apply first with just resume/cover letter, practice) companies. Apply to companies in waves
- Apply to approximately 200 jobs?!
- What is a wave? How many jobs per day: 2 weeks 50 applications (10 application, 1 phone screen). If company doesn't get back to you, they're just disorganized. Follow up on company
- Working at big recognizable companies
- 2 introductions to alumni
- what companies don't work out well? The ones that run out of funding
- half work in rails, web developer, other half go into other type of work

- Job description is wishlist (Eg, when ask for CS degree, would like someone who knows programming because no training, 5 years experience is just wish)

# Pairboarding
* 2 questions, 2 answers, 16 sets of questions

# How to apply ot jobs
* W1D3: keep template of companies consider applying to. Keep list of 200 companies that can apply to. Then rank them-- see if get alum or reference or just apply
* You do X and X is interesting for Y -- just to confirm you aren't blasting out emails
- Make address similar to city you are applying to
- Apply to companies rather than openings
- Apply multiple ways: tweeting, quora, email, linkedIn contact companies
- Follow up on rejected companies (especially if #1 company)
- Keep following up after every 1 week (follow up on product announcement). I know how hard it is to find good candidates, why don't you send me a coding challenge?
- TODO: Find companies in jobberwocky and excel sheet
* TODO: Don't have resumes look the same
* Think about how to make application stand out-- have JavaScript demo that they can play with
* Join product companies versus consulting company - product companies pay better and have more mobility

# Step for applying
* Phases:
1) find companies to apply to, build job search materials (From scorecard)
2) 5 minutes to come up with blurb
3) In email, include resume/cover letter
4) Don't *really* need to have great github
5) Non-technical: resume, linkedIn, attention to detail (typos). Do you appear professional (Restful, json API). When technical: emphasize like technologies, will try, really care about work
6) Weaker might be knowing where to start

# In coding challenges, follow best practices-- follow more dogmatic procedures (git/testing)
