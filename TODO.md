# Final Checklist
(Review last week)

- [ ] Use your own custom domain (no herokuapps.com subdomain)
- [ ] Have a guest account (or two, if you need both to demo)
- [ ] Have well groomed seed data (real world stuff, no lorem ipsum)
- [ ] Have buttons to fill out complex forms while demoing (with nice seed data)
- [ ] Have a root homepage
- [ ] Have a one to three sentences statement on your homepage describing your app ("A Tumblr clone", "A Rap Genius clone to annotate dolphin sounds" etc. Make it painfully obvious what your app does at first glance. You do not have to be witty. Use a big font size. This will look cool and be clear to employers with squirrel attention spans.)
- [ ] It is very important when demoing your app that when you do actions, like save, befriend, delete, modify, etc. something visually happens on the page to acknowledge the action. This is important user feedback and is crucial for any serious web app.
- [ ] Add flash messages to acknowledge saves, etc.
- [ ] Add a user notification model if this makes sense for your app (most likely it does!). This will show feedback and results of actions. Think of Facebook notifications for new comments, friend requests, etc. This translates well to most apps (new annotations, new posts, etc.). It is a good technological challenge and demos well. You probably need polymorphic associations.
- [ ] Style :hover actions of input, buttons and links, to show you can click on things. More visual feedback!
- [ ] Don't have any unstyled pages, no matter how insignificant.
- [ ] It is more important to have a consistent design applied everywhere, however minimal, than something fancy here and there, and others painfully untouched.
- [ ] Style your input, textarea and button tags (use the same size font, color, etc. as the rest of your app, else they stick out like a sore thumb)
- [ ] Make your overall text size big
- [ ] Add helpful tips of a sentence here and there on the spot in your app to guide the user through your app. This makes your implemented features extra obvious.
- [ ] Ask another student to walk through your app, give them instructions beforehand, and watch them do this on their own, without help. See where they struggle to understand features. Return this favor!
- [ ] Write a killer README covering concept, features, technologies and a bunch of future todos (even if it's unlikely you'll ever do it, it shows that you have thought about better ways to implement features, etc.)

Finally, if you want bonus points, take an hour and read the book "[Don't Make Me Think](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/ref=sr_1_1)" by Steve Krug. It's a fun and easy read, and most of all, you'll be able to apply it right away to your app. Most likely you will win points with interviewers for knowing or mentioning this book. It's a dearly loved book, and one of Jonathan's all time favorites.

Double-bonus: [Make a logo](http://www.squarespace.com/logo) for your site.
